Although we will only be running a few functions in this tutorial, a lot of complex things are happening behind the scenes. At the end of the tutorial I will recommend another tutorial and more reading to learn about those behing-the-scenes components."

The low resolution datasets will be used for global alignment and the high resolution datasets will be used for local alignment corrections. It's assumed that the datasets do not fit into memory so they are all \"lazy loaded\" with zarr. Of course, we also need to know the voxel sampling rate in microns, so that is extracted from the image file metadata."
